ORMM
Operations Research Models & Methods (ORMM) implements Paul A. Jensen's Excel Packages in modern Python.  His Excel packages were last updated in 2011, and while I believe they do still work (for the most part), I fear that his incredible work may become outdated in a couple of ways:
1) Excel is not as commonly used for OR, except in settings where security is of the utmost concern, and modern languages like Python, R, Julia, or AMPL are not available
2) While his website and packages are still available at https://www.me.utexas.edu/~jensen/ORMM/, some sections are/may become unusable.  The animations rely on Flash, which is being phased out in google chrome and other web browsers.
3) His work is not nearly as visible as I believe it deserves - any OR practitioner can find value in studying his examples of applications, and use his model implementations to great effect.
