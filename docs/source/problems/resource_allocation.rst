Problem Description
===================
The Resource Allocation Problem optimizes using scarce resources for valued activities.
The resources are limited by some maximum quantity available, while the activities have some numeric value assigned to each of them.
A matrix-like parameter shows all of the resources needed to conduct one unit of that activity (:py:obj:`ResourceNeeds`).
This type of problem is seen often, with a few examples being production management and budget allocation.

Definitions
===========

Sets
----
- :py:obj:`Activities` - Set of activities that are available to produce

   - :py:obj:`a in Activities` or :math:`a \in A`

- :py:obj:`Resources` - Set of resources that are used to conduct activities

   - :py:obj:`r in Resources` or :math:`r \in R`

Parameters
----------
- :py:obj:`Values` - measure of value from conducting one unit of :py:obj:`Activity a`

   - :py:obj:`Values[a] for a in Activities` or :math:`V_a \enspace \forall a \in A`

- :py:obj:`ResourceNeeds` - amount of :py:obj:`Resource r` needed for :py:obj:`Activity a`

   - :py:obj:`ResourceNeeds[r, a] for r in Resources for a in Activities` or :math:`N_{r,a} \enspace \forall r \in R, a \in A`

   .. note::

      To conduct one unit of :py:obj:`Activity a`, you need all resources required.
      For example, to conduct one unit of :py:obj:`Activity a_1`, you need :py:obj:`sum(ResourceNeeds[r, a_1] for r in Resources)`

- :py:obj:`MaxResource` - maximum amount of units available of :py:obj:`Resource r`

   - :py:obj:`MaxResource[r] for r in Resources` or :math:`M_r \enspace \forall r \in R`

- :py:obj:`MaxActivity` - maximum amount of demand for :py:obj:`Activity a`

   - :py:obj:`MaxActivity[a] for a in Activities` or :math:`M_a \enspace \forall a \in A`

Decision Variables
------------------
- :py:obj:`NumActivity` - number of units to conduct of :py:obj:`Activity a`

   - :py:obj:`NumActivity[a] for a in Activities` or :math:`X_a \enspace \forall a \in A`

Objective
=========
**Maximize** total value of activities being conducted.

.. math::

   \text{Max} \sum_{a \in A} V_aX_a

Constraints
===========
- An :py:obj:`Activity a` cannot be conducted more than its :py:obj:`MaxActivity`

.. math::

   0 \leq X_a \leq M_a \quad \forall a \in A

- To conduct 1 unit of an Activity, all :py:obj:`ResourceNeeds` are required.
  In other words, :py:obj:`sum(ResourceNeeds[r,a] for r in Resources)` must happen per :py:obj:`Activity a` conducted.
  This is implied by the problem parameters given by the user and the next constraint.
- The amount of resources used for a :py:obj:`Resource r` must not exceed :py:obj:`MaxResource[r]`

.. math::

    \sum_{a \in A} N_{r,a}X_a \leq M_r \quad \forall r \in R
